	<h1>Our Menu</h1>

			<h4 class="menu-title menu-title-center">Chips at Comptoir Gascon</h4>
			
			<p>Comptoir Gascon, a French bistro, traiteur and pâtisserie, is an accessible offshoot of the phenomenally successful fine-dining restaurant Club Gascon opposite Smithfield Market. Appropriately for a restaurant specialising in the food of south-west France, the French fries are twice-cooked in duck fat. But careful choice of fat is not the only bit of Gallic polish the kitchen adds to these chips magnifiques. The tatties are hand-cut 8-10cm long and 1cm square. The final flourish is ‘crazy salt’ – a mixture of fleur de sel salt and piment d’Espelette pepper.</p>

			<h4  class="menu-title menu-title-center">Panipuri at Sakonis</h4>
			<p>A landmark on Ealing Road, Sakonis attracts a cross-section of the local Indian vegetarian population. It’s a huge, café-style operation. Gujarati and South Indian dishes abound, and such is the throughput of customers that most buffet choices remain fresh and (where appropriate) crisp. There are various bhelpuris, all of them a sour-sweet confection of deep-fried puffed rice and diced vegetables, made tangy by tamarind sauce. Our favourite is the panipuri – crack open the deep-fried shell and fill the crisp interior with a mix of chickpeas, potato, onion and chat masala.</p>

			<h4  class="menu-title menu-title-center">Charcuterie at Terroirs</h4>
			<p>We’re not saying Terroirs makes the very best charcuterie in London; we reckon Bar Boulud would see off any competition in that regard. Nevertheless, if you eat at this delightful wine bar, do make sure you try the cold meats. The pistachio and pork terrine (£6 small/£9.75 large) in particular is first-class: unctuous and flavour-packed, with appealing textures. The tapas-style bar snacks (Marcona almonds, cheeses) and plats du jour are also appealing.</p>
